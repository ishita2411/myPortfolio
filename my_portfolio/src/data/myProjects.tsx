    description:
      "Engineered a recipe generation pipeline leveraging pretrained models. Executed parallel dense video captioning for event proposals, reduced redundancy with cosine similarity and elevated image analysis of frames using YOLO, harnessed BLIP for image captioning, Resnet for frame-to-feature conversion. Employed ChatGPT for concise caption summarization.Evaluated performance with BERTScore, obtaining commendable results despite absence of model training with latency ~5s",

    description:
      "Conducted multiple experiments to see if movie trailer comments can be used to predict the performance of a movie. The project involved data collection, preprocessing, and sentiment analysis using various machine learning models. The results showed that these comments alone could predict movie performance with 75% accuracy and the accuracy is much higher when other factors are considered.",
